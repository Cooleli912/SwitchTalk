# SwitchTalk
A simple application for the Nintendo Switch which uses the secret web browser to access others via P2P connections.
It is completely open-source and there has been research done too.

# Special Information
Not that I have tested yet, but I think that the 3DS and Wii U might be able to use the application.

# Research
I have done a bit of research previously and it appears that the Switch can run games through GDevelop, This is very interesting, so I realized that I didn't have to use any annoying servers or networking and I could stick with GDevelop's built-in P2P compatibility.

So that's an explanation for why I used GDevelop.
I've actually prepared something even before this project's release!
It was originally going to be a PC game but actually, it works fine on switch too!
To test out GDevelop compatibility on your system, go to:
http://www.eelonline.us/lostleaf through the secret web browser.

This works fine...except it dosen't.

# Bad Lag
Lag is terrible, not unplayable but just not good at all for an action game.
This is a severe issue, action games are not good for this method at all, maybe optimizing could work but I don't know honestly.
But a chat app could do even with lag so that would be just fine, this is why you might experience some strange delay or graphical glitches.

# Running the application
The research is done, sure, but I still haven't released, I just created this repository so I still got some work to do, but the app will be done soon.
